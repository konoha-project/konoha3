Getting started

First of all, you have to get llvm-3.2 from llvm's offical site and build it
for yourself. Luckily, this is easy:
  cd PATH_TO_KONOHA
  make -f src/module/ExecutionEngine/FuelVM/Makefile

and build your konoha.

  cd PATH_TO_KONOHA
  mkdir -p build && \
  ( cd build && \
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && \
    make && \
    make install)
